## Setup

### Yarn 
Ensure `yarn` is installed globally to your local machine. 

Follow the instructions at https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install to either install `yarn` or check your `yarn` version. 

&nbsp;

### Installing Packages
To install a package to the project, use **Expo**:

`expo install [package-name]`

> Expo will use `yarn` under the hood to install the package but it finds a compatible version of the package.

&nbsp;

All packages are tracked in the `package.json` file under `dependencies`. 

To install all packages from the `package.json` file, use: 

`expo install` 

> You should run this command every time you pull down the repo to make sure you have everything installed.
